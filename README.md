# PSD_dataset

##  This dataset is created DVHPSugar (Dataset of VHP sugar crystal) a rich image dataset for crystals of sucrose from sugarcane  for Particle Size Distribution (PSD) evaluation with Deep Learning in Images research.

## The file sugar04.zip has images of segmented crystals to train the Deep Learning model to identify segmentation process. The labels of classification can be found in files labels_grains.xlsx and identify_grain.ipynb

## The file sugar01.zip has the images of aglomerated crystals used to evaluate the PSD . The crystall holder-Q6- dimensions are (x,y)=(14.13,12.76) in millimeters.

## Additional images are available in file sugar02.zip for six different crystal holders (Q1 to Q6) with dimensions Q1=(4.6,4.6), Q2=(9.1,9.5), Q3=(8.2,10.17),Q4=(7.03,7.03), Q5=(16.16,16.16) and  Q6=(14.13,12.76) in millimeters.
